""" Parameters explained.
 
    N:                  Number of points on the interval.
    initialStartPoint:  Leftmost point of the first interval.
    initialEndPoint:    Rightmost point of the first interval.    
    limitOfIterations:  Defines the number of iterations. 
    
    Algorithm explained.
    
    1: Calculate a set of points (x) between some interval on real line.
    2: Evalute the function f at these point.
    3: Find out which of the points (x) gives the minimum value of f.
    4: Find out if minimum point belongs to left or right half of the interval.
    5: Define a new interval. This new interval is either the left or right 
        half of the old interval.
    6: Repeat this algorithm for the number of 'limitOfIterations'.
    7: Print the result and plot of graph.
    
    
    Some inspiration for this algorithm may have come from Cantor set:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set
